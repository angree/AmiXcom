# Kill ONLY the WinUAE instances started with one of OUR configs.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: filtering by the executable path is NOT enough. The user runs
# other Amiga machines from the SAME winuae.exe (a StarCraft setup, among
# others), so `Get-Process winuae | Where Path -like 'I:\GITHUB\Amiga_OpenTTD*'`
# matched theirs too and shot it down mid-session. The only thing that tells the
# instances apart is the COMMAND LINE - which .uae file it was given.
#
# Usage:
#   powershell -File kill_ours.ps1                # every oxc-*.uae instance
#   powershell -File kill_ours.ps1 -Config oxc-rtg # just that one
param(
    [string]$Config = ""
